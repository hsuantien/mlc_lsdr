Multi-Label Classification with Label Space Dimension Reduction
======

The program consists of five linear label space transformation approaches.  The base learner used in all approaches is regularized linear regression with a fixed regularization parameter.  Please see the usage in demo.m .

* Binary Relevance with Random Discarding (BR), Principal Label Space Transformation (PLST) are developed in

  Farbound Tai and Hsuan-Tien Lin. Multilabel classification with principal label space transformation. Neural Computation, 24(9):2508--2542, September 2012.

* Conditional Principal Label Space Transformation (CPLST) is developed
